                            pursuing her passion for instrumental music. She also completed her BA Honours degree in

                            her educational achievements, Sanduni is also the concertmaster of the Gustav Mahler Society
                            of Colombo. Her love for

                            herself through her Violin and her motive is to create a better future and a safe space for

                            Barbora Valiukevičiūtė is a
                            world-renowned violinist, conductor, and producer. She has performed at prestigious music
                            venues worldwide, including the Metropolitan Museum Concert Hall and National Philharmonic
                            of Lithuania. Barbora is the
                            founder of the Baltic Duet and launched the annual summer music cycle, Koncertai Burmistrui,
                            in Merkinė. She is also a
                            sought-after teacher, having taught at the Barenboim-Said Foundation in Palestine and The
                            Merit School of Music in
                            Chicago. Barbora's exceptional work has made her an ambassador for the Kaunas European
                            Capital of Culture 2022. She
                            studied violin in Lithuania and Italy before continuing her studies in the USA with renowned

                            create positive change in the
                            world. Barbora believes that music has the power to bring people together and to inspire
